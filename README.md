From top hotels to the best restaurants and bars in town to ideas on what activities one can enjoy with their kids.<br>TravelMag allows the user to explore a curated collection of articles that list out the most famous and best of each category. The user can easily plan the itinerary for their trip with information about places to visit as well as flight prices, weather, and hotels.<br>The application is accessible under: https://shielded-sierra-26115.herokuapp.com/</p>  

### Core features

#### Submit page
 <p> The submit page is here so that people can submit a city that they know very well to the database. They'll have to enter information and links about all the topics that are part of TravelMag and can optionally also include their information (to tell other users what makes them an expert on the city).</p>
